# Meteor React Latest

Start kit repository using:
- Meteor (build tool, backend/frontend setup)
- GraphQL with Apollo (apollo server and apollo react client)
- React (view)
- Material-UI (UI component library)
- Flexbox (css feature to organize HTML elements)

The goal is always to keep this repository up-to-date dependency-wise and with great organization. We can also extract common parts and publish npm and meteor packages, that way this repository can be cloned or forked to start new products with this stack. 

Maybe in the future we have a simple skeleton here that depends on external packages without any code to be deleted after cloned to create a new product. Right now we have sample and start kit code together.

To have a path to follow we choose to build a TODO App as a working sample, we know, there are a lot of them out there, it is just to practice and learn.
